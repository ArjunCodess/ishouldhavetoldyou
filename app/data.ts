export const myStory = `i'm arjun. i'm in 10th grade. and i'm leaving school.

i was supposed to have two more years. i was supposed to live through all of it, say the things that mattered, be brave when it counted. instead, i'm doing dummy and walking away.

i'm an iit-jee aspirant now. which sounds like this grand plan, but really it just means school has become a place where i spend all day preparing for an exam that's still years away. it means i stopped being a kid who goes to class and became a kid who's always thinking about the next test.

but here's the thing that's been eating at me, the reason i made this website. there are so many words stuck in my chest. words for people i cared about. words i should have said when i had the chance. maybe i was scared of what would happen if i actually spoke up. maybe i thought people already knew what i felt. maybe i just didn't know how to say it.

each name on this site is a person who mattered to me. the ones i loved, the ones who hurt me, all of them. and next to each name are letters. not real letters. more like all the things i wish i could tell them. all the words that have been weighing me down.

this website is me finally opening my mouth. it's messy and honest. it's everything i held inside for years. and i'm grateful for everyone here, because you made me who i am.

thank you for being part of my story.`;

there are a thousand small moments i replay in my head, the way you laughed at my worst jokes, how you always knew when something was wrong without me having to say it.

i was scared. scared of what admitting it would mean. scared of losing you. so i said nothing.

now all i have are these words on a screen, and a heart full of everything i never said.`,

i never told you that i noticed. that i was so desperately grateful.

thank you for being the constant when everything else crumbled. thank you for your hands, your voice, your endless, quiet love.

i love you. i always have.`,

you were enough. you are enough. more than enough.`,

thank you for everything you never asked to be thanked for.`,
